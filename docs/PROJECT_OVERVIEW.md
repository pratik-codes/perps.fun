# DegenWars.fun â€“ Trade to Survive, Battle to Win

## Problem

95% of traders lose money.

Trading is often lonely â€“ wins and losses are kept to yourself.

Communities sit in Discord chats, trying to make it less boring.

Beginners struggle â€“ trades feel complicated, and they can't even see winning strategies to learn from.

There's no fun, no game, no thrill in just clicking charts alone.
